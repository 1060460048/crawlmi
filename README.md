Highly optimized web scraping framework in Python.

Many parts of this repository are either direct copy or inspired by [Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy) and
[w3lib](https://github.com/scrapy/w3lib) repositories.

Core components has been reimplement and optimized for my personal use. Project is still in development phase and
the documentation is not available at the moment.
